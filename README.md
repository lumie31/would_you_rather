# <b>Would You Rather?</b>

## Project Overview
In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.


## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of this project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Installing
- Open your local development terminal
- `cd` into the directory that you want the project to reside
- Clone this repository into that directory
- Run yarn install to install the project dependencies
- Run yarn start to start a local development server
- Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a pseudo backend server for students to develop against. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend. The required files have been incorporated into this project.

## Note

As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost when the browser is refreshed.
